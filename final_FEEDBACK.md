## PA2 final grading

### Correctness/Completeness: Blind

| Result   | Description                              |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| **YES-** | Code follows final algorithm             |
| **YES-** | User inputs the number of sticks to start with |
| **YES-** | Error checking forces user to keep trying until starting stick count is >=10 and <=100 |
| **YES-** | Clearly 3 players                        |
| **YES-** | Player turns alternate, with the one computer player consistent in which player it is |
| **YES-** | Both human players input sticks 1-3      |
| **YES-** | Error checking makes both human players try again if <1 or >3 |
| **YES-** | Computer player chooses random stick amount OR has smarter steps (note here if smarter algorithm used) |
| **YES-** | Game continues until someone takes the last stick |
| **YES-** | No player gets a turn after last stick is taken |
| **YES-** | Number of losses for each player calculated correctly |
| **YES-** | After game ends, user is asked if they want to play again |
| **YES-** | If user says yes, game restarts and works correctly, starting with choice of starting sticks |
| **-NO** | Number of losses for each player output at end of the game |
| **-NO** | No other logic errors                    |

### Usability: Blind

| Result   | Description                              |

| **YES-** | Clear, well-formatted output             |
| **YES-** | Rules of game output at start            |
| **YES-** | User can understand what happened on computer’s turn |
| **YES-** | Number of sticks left output after each player’s turn |

### Supporting Documents for participation

### Comments on the grading
- If there are NOs in this FEEDBACK document, address it according to the description
- Although the number of losses for each player is not recorded and displayed well, this algorithm and your work looks great
- 
### Grade: E
