| Result  | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **YES-** | Has good usability (purpose, good prompts)      |
| **YES-** | Has correct number of players                   |
| **YES-** | User chooses number of sticks to start with     |
| **YES-** | Error checking on number of sticks to start with|
| **YES-** | Error checking on number of sticks picked up    |
| **YES-** | User player logic is correct                    |
| **YES-** | Computer player logic is correct                |
| **YES-** | Switching turns is correct                      |
| **YES-** | Playing until a game ends is correct            |
| **-NO** | Can play as many games as desired, with user input ending |
| **-NO** | Keeps track of losses for each player           |
| **-NO** | Outputs information about losses                |

### Comments on the grading
- If there are NOs in this FEEDBACK document, address it according to the description
- We haven't discussed how to write function algorithms yet, so there is no need to use functions for this PA. You can do all of it with just a while loop. 
- However, there are some good beats in this algorithm, and you can update it in your final design.
