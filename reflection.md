The purpose of this PA was to practice what we have learned in class with using error checking and looping. I enjoyed 
working on this assignment because it was fun to figure out how to get the game working. I had trouble storing how many 
loses each player had. I also used a function for this assignment because it made sense to me for when you ask the user 
if they want to play again, you can just use the function.
